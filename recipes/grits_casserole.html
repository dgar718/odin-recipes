            <li>Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Pour into the skillet used to cook the sausage. Lightly scramble
                eggs over medium-low heat, then mix into grits mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour grits mixture into the prepared baking dish. Dot with remaining butter, sprinkle with remaining 1
                cup
